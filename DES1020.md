# DES1020: The Design Process

* Students develop an understanding of design problems through research and select, generate and evaluate possible solutions.
* Prerequisite: None

## Assignment 1 - Design Brief

* You will be **designing** and **printing** your own 3D object examples could include a key fob, cookie cutters, pen holder, board game piece, terrarium decoration, or a replacement part for some larger device. For more *ideas* check out [Thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com), but don't simply download a model. Create a **design brief** (on paper or digitally) that includes:

  1. A description of the object you want to build and why you want to build it.
  1. A rough sketch of your object with dimensions (x, y, and z), preferably in millimeters.
  1. Why you are wanting to design this object and the purpose it will serve.

Submit your design brief document or a photo of it.

## Assignment 2 - 3D Modelling

Using your design brief as a guide, create a 3D model of your object.

* If you have never used [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com), follow the [tutorials](https://www.tinkercad.com/3d-design) to get started.
* If you prefer other 3D modelling programs such as [Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/products/sketchup-for-web) or [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/education/fusion-360) feel free to use it.


Export your model as an [STL file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) for 3D printing and to hand in.

## Assignment 3 - 3D Printing

Now that you have your STL file prepared, use the software on the 3D printer computers (or install it on your own computer) to slice your model for printing. Then follow the instructions to print your sliced file.

Take a picture of your completed object to submit.

## Assignment 4 - Self-Evaluation

In a document or slide deck, write a self-evaluation that includes:
  1. Was the intention of your model successfully met?
  1. What worked well about your process?
  1. What could have gone better?
  1. What specific alternations or changes would you make that could enhance the quality of your model?
  1. Would this model be useful for others? Why or why not?
  1. What are two things your learned through this process?

Complete an [Employability Skills Self-Assessment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeg5oKGSpVoPOOobLzBy20qugNRzDVHIJ4GU4AR6stKZwMFeg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1608836029=DES1012) and a [Personal Inventory Checklist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOEdGul7Omr2ggimeQU-dwUKrWGPU9t52ocposyntKgm7Kjg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1721107223=DES1020).

## Outcomes

The student will:

1. identify the steps in the design process
    1. recognize and apply the components of the design process, including:
        1. identifying the problem or need (design brief)
        2. researching the problem
        3. generating ideas and visualizing potential solutions
        4. choosing the best solution
        5. choosing the best method of presentation
        6. making or modelling a solution
        7. presenting the solution
        8. evaluating the solution
    2. identify the elements; e.g., line, shape (2-D) or form (3-D), colour, texture, depth (perspective), light, direction (motion), mass (visual weight), tone (black and white) or value (colour), space (positive and negative)
    3. identify the principles of design, e.g., balance, emphasis, proportion (scale), repetition (rhythm/pattern), unity, contrast, harmony, proximity and variety, as they apply to form and function
2. apply the steps in the design process through production of a designed solution
    1. follow the design process to create solutions for one or more 2-D or 3-D projects
    2. select and use appropriate tools and materials as outlined in the design brief
    3. effectively communicate intentions and decision making related to the design project; e.g., form, function, aesthetics
    4. use and maintain tools and materials in a safe and appropriate manner
3. present a portfolio-ready drawing, rendering or model that the student produced
    1. present sketches, drawings and/or models for assessment
    2. maintain a design folder, journal or sketchbook as part of the portfolio of ongoing observational drawing and modelling activities
4. identify copyright restrictions and permissions and put them into practice
5. apply consistent and appropriate work station routines
    1. demonstrate good health and safety practices; e.g., posture, positioning of hardware and furniture
    2. demonstrate security for hardware, software, supplies and personal work
    3. show trogram
6. demonstrate basic competencies
    1. demonstrate fundamental skills to:
        1. communicate
        2. manage information
        3. use numbers
        4. think and solve problems
    2. demonstrate personal management skills to:
        1. demonstrate positive attitudes and behaviours
        2. be responsible
        3. be adaptable
        4. learn continuously
        5. work safely
    3. demonstrate teamwork skills to:
        1. work with others
        2. participate in projects and tasks
7. make personal connections to the cluster content and processes to inform possible pathway choices
    1. complete/update a personal inventory; e.g., interests, values, beliefs, resources, prior learning and experiences
    2. create a connection between personal inventory and occupational choices
